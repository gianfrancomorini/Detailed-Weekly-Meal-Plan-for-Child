Detailed Weekly Meal Plan for Child

# Child Weekly Meal Calendar App

This Streamlit application generates a weekly meal calendar designed for children. It provides two meals per day for a week, complete with preparation instructions and a list of ingredients. The ingredients are linked to Amazon with a referral code, allowing for easy purchase and planning.

## Features

- Random weekly meal plan generation with a single click.
- Two meals per day for each day of the week.
- Preparation explanations for each meal.
- Ingredient list with Amazon referral links.

## How to Run the App

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Streamlit using pip:

   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. Clone this repository or download the script `meal_calendar.py` to your local machine.
4. Run the Streamlit app with the following command:

   ```
   streamlit run meal_calendar.py
   ```

5. The app should now be running in your default web browser.

## Customization

You can customize the meal options by editing the `meals` dictionary in the script. Each meal must have a name, an explanation, and a list of ingredients.

## Dependencies

- Streamlit
- Random (part of the standard Python library)

## Note on Amazon Links

The script generates static Amazon search URLs with a referral tag. To dynamically generate URLs based on real-time Amazon data, you would need access to the Amazon Product Advertising API, which is beyond the scope of this script.

## Disclaimer

The referral links provided in this script are placeholders. You will need to replace them with your actual Amazon referral links.

This README assumes that the application is straightforward and doesn't involve advanced features like database connectivity or third-party API integration (apart from the static Amazon links). Adjust the content as necessary to match the actual functionality and setup of your app.
